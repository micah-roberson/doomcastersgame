# DoomCaster - Simplified Core Game

## 🎮 Three-Button System

When you click any spell in your spellbook, you'll see three buttons:

### 🔵 **Ability Button**
- Only works with **Fuse** spells
- Lets you attach the spell as a modifier to another spell
- The spell is removed and becomes a +X modifier

### 🔴 **Cast Button** 
- Attacks an area with the spell's damage
- Triggers **Combo** bonuses if elements match
- **Banish** spells are removed from game after casting

### ⚫ **Discard Button**
- Removes spell to discard pile (not removed from game)
- Use when you need space for new spells

## ⚡ Core Abilities

### **Fuse**
- **Shape Water** has this ability
- Click Ability button → Select target spell
- Attaches as modifier using the card's **Modifier Value**
- Example: Shape Water (+3) fused to Fireball = Fireball now has +3 attack

### **Combo [Element]**
- **Gather Wind** has "Combo [Fire] or [Water] or [Earth] = +1 ATK"
- If you played Fire, Water, OR Earth this turn, get +1 bonus damage
- Elements are tracked when you cast spells

### **Banish**
- **Unleash Void** and **Essence Lance** have this
- Spell is completely removed from game after casting (not just discarded)
- Cannot be recovered by any means
