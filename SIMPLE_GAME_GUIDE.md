# DoomCaster - Pure Fuse Demo

## 🎮 Three-Button System

When you click any spell in your spellbook, you'll see three buttons:

### 🔵 **Ability Button**
- Only works with **Fuse** spells (Shape Water, Crystal Shard, Void Echo)
- Click to select the spell as a modifier
- Then click another spell to attach it to

### 🔴 **Cast Button** 
- Attacks an area with the spell's total damage
- Uses base attack + all modifier bonuses
- Spell gets tapped after casting

### ⚫ **Discard Button**
- Removes spell to discard pile
- Use when you need space for new spells

## ⚡ Core Mechanic: Fuse

### **How Fuse Works**
1. **Shape Water** or **Crystal Shard** have Fuse ability
2. Click their **Ability** button
3. Select target spell to attach to
4. The Fuse spell becomes a +X modifier on the target

### **Chain Fusing** ✨
- When a spell with **Fuse** ability is attached as a modifier
- The target spell **gains Fuse ability**!
- This allows unlimited chaining of fuses
- Build incredibly powerful spell combinations

### **Example Chain**
1. Fuse Shape Water (+3) to Fireball → Fireball gains Fuse ability
2. Fuse Crystal Shard (+4) to Fireball → Fireball now 4+3+4=11 attack
3. Fireball can now fuse to other spells too!

## 🃏 Card Information

Every spell shows:
- **Attack Value**: Base damage when cast
- **Modifier Value**: How much it adds when fused (+X in purple)
- **Element**: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, or Void
- **Fuse Ability**: Only some spells have this initially

## 🧙‍♂️ Starting Spells
