## üéÆ How to Use the Three-Button System

When you click on a spell in your spellbook, you'll see three buttons:

### üîµ **Ability Button**
- Activates the spell's special ability without casting it
- Examples:
  - **Shape Water (Fuse)**: Select another spell to attach this one as a modifier
  - **Raise Earth (Scout Area)**: View details of an area card
  - **Unleash Void (Refresh Spell Row)**: Replace all spells in the spell row

### üî¥ **Cast Button**
- Attacks an area with the spell's damage
- Processes abilities during combat (Attune, Add To Element, etc.)
- Spell gets tapped after casting

### ‚ö´ **Discard Button**
- Removes the spell from your spellbook to the discard pile
- Use when you need space for new spells

## ‚ö° Implemented Abilities

### **Add (x) To [Element]**
- Modifier that adds bonus damage only to spells of a specific element
- Applied during damage calculation if spell element matches
- Example: "Add (3) To [Fire]" gives +3 damage to fire spells only

### **Attune [Element]**
- Changes the spell's element when activated or cast
- Can be used strategically to bypass immunities
- Example: Attune [Wind] changes a fire spell to wind

### **Banish**
- Spell is removed from the game (not just discarded) after casting
- Cannot be revived or recovered
- Powerful spells often have this limitation

### **Combo [Element]**
- Grants bonus damage if required elements were played earlier this turn
- "or" = any one element needed
- "and" = all elements needed
- Example: "Combo [Fire] or [Water] = +3 ATK"

### **Consume Spell (x)**
- Area ability that requires sacrificing x spells before attacking
- Spells are automatically discarded when you attack these areas
- Plan your attacks carefully with these areas

### **Free Combo**
- Bypasses all combo requirements automatically
- Always triggers regardless of elements played
- Processes before all other modifiers

### **Fuse**
- Attach this spell as a modifier to another spell
- Must be the last (newest) modifier attached
- Creates powerful spell combinations

### **Refresh Spell Row**
- Replaces all 5 spells in the spell row with new ones
- Great for finding better spell options
- Can be activated via Ability button or during cast

### **Scout Area**
- Reveals information about area cards
- Shows defense, immunity, and abilities
- Use for strategic planning

## üéØ Strategic Tips

1. **Use Ability First**: Many spells are more valuable for their abilities than damage
2. **Plan Element Combos**: Play different elements to set up combo bonuses
3. **Manage Consume Spell**: Keep extra spells when facing these areas
4. **Save Banish Spells**: Use these for high-priority targets only
5. **Fuse Strategically**: Create powerful spell combinations
6. **Scout Before Attacking**: Know what you're facing
7. **Time Attune Carefully**: Use to bypass immunities

## üîÑ Turn Flow

1. **Acquire** new spells if you have space
2. **Use Abilities** to set up combos or gather information
3. **Cast Spells** to attack areas (max 3 per turn)
4. **Plan Elements** for next turn's combos
5. **End Turn** to reset and continue
